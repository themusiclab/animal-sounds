# Humans share acoustic preferences with other animals
This is the repository for "Humans share acoustic preferences with other animals" by Logan S James, Sarah C Woolley, Jon T Sakata, Courtney B Hilton, Michael J Ryan and Samuel A Mehr (2025, bioRxiv). A URL to the paper will be posted here when it becomes available.

## Anatomy of the repo
Currently, the manuscript is produced manually, from output that uses the following files:

- `animal-sounds-data.csv` contains participant responses
- `AcousticFeatures.xlsx` contains acoustic outputs
- `SpeciesList.nwk` contains the phylogenetic tree
- `animal-sounds-analysis.Rmd` contains all analysis code

Running the Rmd generates output in the `/results` and `/viz` directories, including all analyses in the Results section of the paper and base images for the visualizations.

## Assistance
